title: terser v4.2.1
---
Version 4.2.1 is out!

### Here's what's new:

 - Minor refactors
 - Fixed a bug similar to [#369](https://github.com/terser-js/terser/issues/369) in collapse_vars
 - Functions can no longer be inlined into a place where they're going to be compared with themselves.
 - reduce_funcs option is now legacy, as using reduce_vars without reduce_funcs caused some weird corner cases. As a result, it is now implied in reduce_vars and can't be turned off without turning off reduce_vars.
 - Bug which would cause a random stack overflow has now been fixed.

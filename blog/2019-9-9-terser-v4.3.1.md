Version 4.3.1 is out!

### Here's what's new:

 - Fixed an issue from 4.3.0 where any block scope within a for loop erroneously had its parent set to the function scopee
 - Fixed an issue where compressing IIFEs with argument expansions would result in some parameters becoming undefined
 - addEventListener options argument's properties are now part of the DOM properties list.

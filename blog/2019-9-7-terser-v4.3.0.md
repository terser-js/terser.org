title: terser v4.3.0
---
Version 4.3.0 is out!

### Here's what's new:

 - Do not drop computed object keys with side effects
 - Functions passed to other functions in calls are now wrapped in parentheses by default, which speeds up loading most modules
 - Objects with computed properties are now less likely to be hoisted
 - Speed and memory efficiency optimizations
 - Fixed scoping issues with `try` and `switch`
